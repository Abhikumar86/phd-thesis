Abhishek Kumar Chandigarh, India "],["abstract.html", "Abstract", " Abstract There is a high consensus that the average global temperature has been increasing due to anthropogenic activities only during the last century. This phenomenon has significantly affected functioning of ecosystems and almost all the ecosystems are now facing notable changes. Thus, many of the species have shifted to suitable habitats (either elevational or latitudinal) due to pressure posed by the changing environment. While animals can move as warming happens but plants are stationary organisms and cannot move; so, the difference in the distribution of various plant life stages can be an indication that plants are responding to climate change effects. Although the impacts of climate change on the biodiversity have been documented globally, but limited information is available about such impacts on plant diversity of low-elevation Himalayan region. Improved understanding is urgently needed to assess how these changes cascade into the distributions of species in space and time, and ultimately, what they might mean for the low elevation ecosystems. Therefore, such information is very important as these low-elevation environments are expected to be among most susceptible to ongoing climate change. This vulnerability highlights the importance of identifying the key drivers of elevational plant richness pattern as well as the landscape architecture that support the persistence of species populations and richness. This synopsis is the proposed research plan of my PhD research work that could be helpful to fill these gaps in the research. I will address the following key objectives: (i) Examining diversity pattern along elevational gradient, (ii) Examining distribution pattern along elevational gradient and, (iii) Detecting any shifts in distributions and correlating with changing environmental conditions. The outcomes of this research work might be useful for policy makers and effective conservation of species that are sensitive to climate change. Moreover, this can provide a baseline data for plant distribution and diversity patterns in relation to impacts of climate change.

The aim of the introduction is to contextualise the proposed research. In the opening paragraph, give an overall view of what is included in the chapter. For example: This chapter outlines the background (section 2.1) and context (section 2.2) of the research, and its purposes (section 2.3).

The aim of the literature review chapter is to delineate various theoretical positions and from these to develop a conceptual framework for generation of hypotheses and setting up the research question. The literature review chapter needs to: Critically evaluate the literature rather than merely describe previous literature (i.e., what is good/bad about the body of literature?). Show a synthesis and be integrated rather than being more like an annotated bibliography. Identify key authors and the key works in the area, thus acquainting the reader with existing studies relative to what has been found, who has done work, when and where latest research studies were completed and what approaches to research methodology were followed (literature review of methodology sometimes saved for chapter on methodology). Constitute an argument. Clearly identify the gap in the literature that is being addressed by the research question. Suitable sources for the literature review include: General integrative reviews cited that relate to the problem situation or research problem such as those found in psychological and sociological reviews of research. Specific books, monographs, bulletins, reports, and research articles  preference shown in most instances for literature of the last 10 years. Unpublished materials (e.g., dissertations, theses, papers presented at recent professional meetings not yet in published form, etc.). The literature review chapter can be arranged in terms of the questions to be considered or objectives/purposes set out in the Introduction chapter. Start with an overview of this chapter by outlining the topics to be discussed. For example [your thesis may have more than 3 topics and therefore more sections]: This chapter begins with a historical background [optional] (section 3.1) and reviews literature on the following topics: topic 1 (section 2.2) [briefly describe the topic]; topic 2 (section 2.3) [briefly describe the topic]; and topic 3 (section 2.4) [briefly describe the topic]. Section 2.5 highlights the implications from the literature and develops the conceptual framework for the study. "],["history.html", "3.1 Historical Background", " 3.1 Historical Background According to Linnaeus, the earth was covered with water except some mountain peaks and these mountain peaks were first colonized by plants and animals. As water level comes down and peaks were emerged new biota has colonized and diversified (Lomolino, 2001). Willdenow (1805) was the first to associate the elevational pattern of species diversity to climate and speculated that warmer regions have more diversity (Lomolino, 2001; Willdenow, 1805). Later, Hocker (1956) has also associated distribution of climatic factors to distribution limits of Pinus taeda L. (Hocker, 1956). According to the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur &amp; Wilson, 1967), the mountains are simply comparable to islands that are isolated from others and therefore due to smaller area and high extinction rates on the mountain tops should have lower species diversity. The observed decline in species richness along the elevation in Crete island supports this view and area alone explains a significant amount of variation in species richness along the elevational gradient (Trigas et al., 2013).
